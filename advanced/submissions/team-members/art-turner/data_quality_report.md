## Q2: How did you identify and treat these anomalies?

### **Multi-Method Detection Approach:**

#### **1. Statistical Methods**
- **Z-Score Analysis:** Identified values >3 standard deviations from mean
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** Detected values outside Q1±1.5×IQR bounds  
- **Modified Z-Score:** Median-based robust detection for skewed distributions

#### **2. Physical Constraint Validation**
- **Temperature:** Checked for impossible values (<-10°C or >55°C)
- **Humidity:** Validated 0-100% range constraints
- **Wind Speed:** Ensured non-negative, reasonable values (<50 m/s)
- **Power Consumption:** Verified positive values only
- **Solar Radiation:** Confirmed non-negative measurements

#### **3. Sensor Pattern Analysis**
- **Stuck Sensor Detection:** Identified excessive value repetition
- **Zero Value Analysis:** Flagged potential sensor disconnection periods
- **Unique Value Assessment:** Detected limited sensor resolution issues

#### **4. Temporal Pattern Analysis**
- **Outlier Clustering:** Identified days with concentrated anomalies
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Peak outlier month: July 2017 (1,747 outliers)
- **Daily Hotspots:** Top outlier day: 2017-07-21 (79 anomalies)

### **Treatment Philosophy:**
- **Conservative Flagging:** Retained borderline cases to preserve data integrity
- **Parallel Dataset Creation:** Maintained both original and cleaned versions
- **No Data Destruction:** Preserved all original measurements for transparency

## Q3: What might be the impact of retaining or removing them in your model?

### **Correlation Impact Analysis:**

**Dataset Comparison:**
- **Original Dataset:** 52,416 observations
- **Clean Dataset:** 44,349 observations (84.6% retained)
- **Removed:** 8,067 observations (15.4%)

**Correlation Changes (Weather vs Total Power):**
| Variable | Original r | Clean r | Change | Impact Level |
|----------|------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Wind Speed** | 0.2217 | 0.1345 | **-0.0872** | **High** |
| **Temperature** | 0.4882 | 0.4145 | **-0.0737** | **High** |
| **Diffuse Flows** | 0.0321 | 0.1042 | **+0.0722** | **High** |
| **Humidity** | -0.2991 | -0.2657 | **+0.0334** | **Moderate** |
| **General Diffuse Flows** | 0.1504 | 0.1471 | **-0.0033** | **Low** |

### **Trade-off Analysis:**

#### **🟢 Retaining Outliers:**
**Advantages:**
- ✅ Captures extreme operational scenarios (peak demands, heat waves)
- ✅ Maintains natural data variability and system response ranges  
- ✅ Preserves critical information for capacity planning
- ✅ Reflects real-world conditions including sensor noise

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ May reduce model stability and increase prediction errors
- ❌ Can inflate error metrics and reduce apparent model performance
- ❌ Potential bias in parameter estimation

#### **🔵 Removing Outliers:**
**Advantages:**
- ✅ Improves model robustness and correlation stability
- ✅ Reduces noise in parameter estimation  
- ✅ Creates cleaner relationships for analysis
- ✅ Better statistical model assumptions

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ May miss critical extreme event patterns
- ❌ Could underestimate system capacity requirements
- ❌ Reduces model's ability to handle operational extremes
- ❌ Loss of 15.4% of valuable data

## **Recommendations:**

### **🎯 Primary Strategy: SELECTIVE TREATMENT**
Given the **15.4% outlier rate** and **significant correlation impacts**, recommend **selective removal** rather than wholesale retention or elimination:

1. **📊 Robust Modeling Techniques:**
   - Apply **Winsorization** (cap extreme values at 95th/5th percentiles)
   - Use **robust regression methods** resistant to outliers
   - Implement **ensemble approaches** with outlier-aware algorithms

2. **🔍 Targeted Cleaning:**
   - **Remove:** Solar radiation outliers >99th percentile (likely sensor errors)
   - **Retain:** Temperature and humidity extremes (represent real weather)
   - **Investigate:** Zone 3 power anomalies (potential load type differences)

3. **📈 Model Architecture:**
   - **Separate models** for extreme vs normal operating conditions
   - **Hierarchical approach** with outlier detection as preprocessing step
   - **Cross-validation** with and without outliers for robustness testing

4. **⚠️ Monitoring & Validation:**
   - **Real-time outlier detection** for operational deployment
   - **Performance comparison** between full and cleaned datasets
   - **Regular model retraining** with updated outlier thresholds

### **📋 Implementation Priority:**
- **High:** Remove solar radiation extreme outliers (>99th percentile)
- **Medium:** Apply robust methods to temperature/wind relationships  
- **Low:** Investigate Zone 3 anomaly patterns for insights

### **🏁 Final Assessment:**
**Data Quality Rating:** FAIR (significant outliers but no impossible values)
**Recommended Action:** Selective treatment with robust modeling techniques
**Risk Level:** Moderate - outliers may represent important system behaviors
