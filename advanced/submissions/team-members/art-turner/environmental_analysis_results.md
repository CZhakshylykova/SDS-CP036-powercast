|------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Zone 1** | **-0.2874** | *** | As humidity ↗️, power ↘️ |
| **Zone 2** | **-0.2950** | *** | As humidity ↗️, power ↘️ |
| **Zone 3** | **-0.2330** | *** | As humidity ↗️, power ↘️ |

#### Additional Inverse Correlations:
- **Zone 3 - Diffuse Flows:** -0.0385 (weak inverse correlation)

**Physical Interpretation:**
- 🌫️ High humidity may reduce cooling needs through perceived temperature effects
- ☁️ Humid conditions often correlate with cloud cover, reducing solar heat gain
- 💨 Natural evaporative cooling effects in humid environments
- 🏠 Reduced indoor temperature perception when humidity is high
