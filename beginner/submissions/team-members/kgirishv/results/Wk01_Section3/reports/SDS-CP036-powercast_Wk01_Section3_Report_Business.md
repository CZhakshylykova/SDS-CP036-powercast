# ðŸ’¼ Week 1 â€“ Section3: Environmental Feature Relationships (Business-Friendly Report)

## Key Questions Answered
**Q1: Which environmental variables correlate most with energy usage?**  
I compared temperature, humidity, wind, and sunlight with energy use in each zone. The AC/Water Heating zone showed the strongest link to temperature and wind; the kitchen was less weather-sensitive.

**Q2: Are any variables inversely correlated with demand in specific zones?**  
Yes. In warmer hours, water heating demand can drop (negative link with temperature), while cooling may increase.

**Q3: Did your analysis differ across zones? Why might that be?**  
Yes. Each zone powers different appliances: the kitchen follows meal schedules; laundry is sporadic; HVAC/water heating track outdoor conditions more closely.
